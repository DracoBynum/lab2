# Lab 2 Narrative

For my two different instances of running the web crawler, I decided to keep the location constant but to run it twice at different times to observe any differences.  I ran them roughly 30 minutes apart from each other.  I noticed that the one I ran later in the day had more frequent usage of the word "weekend", which makes sense as people are probably getting excited for the weekend as the Friday workday was starting to come to a close on the East Coast when I ran the program the second time.   I only ran the program for 60 seconds apeice in order to cut down on the file size (i have limited space on my local drive) so the sample size isn't enormous, but still a useful snapshot of what people were talking about on Twitter over that period in the US.

As you can see, the two maps are incredibly similar, with huge concentrations on the east and west coasts, with very limited tweets originating from Alaska and Hawaii, as well as a limited number from central and midwestern America.

Again, the two clouds are very similar, however there are a few differences in frequency, like both have Go and Out with very high frequency, but in the first one Out is more frequent and the second one Go is more frequent.  Both feature Love with fairly high frequency, but have many other words that are much more sporatically used.  It remains though that the most used words are pretty consistent between the two, and the ones that break through the static are often conjunctions or other less meaningful parts of speech.
